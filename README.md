**Project Overview**  
- DoAble is a simple todo-list application that lets you keep track of your daily tasks.  

**Details on Functionality**
- Users are able to add, delete, and edit todo items on the site's home page. They're also able to navigate to a Contact page if they need to get in touch to report a bug.  

**Technologies Used**  
- This application was mainly built with React, and navigation between pages was configured with React Router, specifically HashRouter. A bootstrap CDN was used to style the page along with a few custom CSS rules. Uuid was also used to generate unique ID's for todo list items.

**Ideas for Future Improvement**  
1. Add a "complete" button that crosses out todo list items

2. Add a feature that lets you filter items by all, completed, and still pending

3. Add a feature that lets you save items to local storage or a login system that lets users save todo lists to a profile. 
 
**User Stores**  
1.  As a student, I want an app where I can log all of my school assignments so I can remember what needs to be done.

2.  As a working professional, I want an app to track and manage my work tasks so I can mark what's completed and what still needs to be done. 

3.  As a person not well-versed in technology, I want a simple to-do app so I can easily track and manage my daily tasks.
