1.  As a student, I want an app where I can log all of my school assignments so I can remember what needs to be done.

2.  As a working professional, I want an app to track and manage my work tasks so I can mark what's completed and what still needs to be done. 

3.  As a person not well-versed in technology, I want a simple to-do app so I can easily track and manage my daily tasks.
